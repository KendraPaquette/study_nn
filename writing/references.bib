  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) can reduce binge drinking events (BDEs: consuming 4+/5+ drinks per occasion for women/men) in young adults, but need to be optimized for timing and content. Delivering just-in-time support messages in the hours prior to BDEs could improve intervention impact. OBJECTIVE: We determined the feasibility of developing a machine learning model to accurately predict future, that is, same-day, 1 to 6-hours prior BDEs using smartphone sensor data. We aimed to identify the most informative phone sensor features associated with BDEs on weekend and weekdays, respectively, to determine the key features that explain prediction model performance. METHODS: We collected phone sensor data from 75 young adults (ages 21-25; mean =22.4, SD=1.9) with risky drinking behavior who reported drinking behavior over 14 weeks. Participants in this secondary analysis were enrolled in a clinical trial. We developed machine learning models testing different algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, decision tree) to predict same-day BDEs (versus low-risk drinking events and non-drinking periods) using smartphone sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, GPS). We tested various "prediction distance" time windows (more proximal: 1-hour; to distant: 6-hour) from drinking onset. We also tested various analysis time windows (i.e., amount of data to be analyzed), ranging from 1 to 12 hours prior to drinking onset, because this determines the amount of data that needs to be stored on the phone to compute the model. Explainable AI (XAI) was used to explore interactions between the most informative phone sensor features contributing to BDEs. RESULTS: The XGBoost model performed best in predicting imminent same-day BDE, with 95.0\% accuracy on weekends and 94.3\% accuracy on weekdays (F1 score = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). This XGBoost model needed 12- and 9-hours of phone sensor data at 3- and 6- hours prediction distance from the onset of drinking, on weekends and weekdays, respectively, prior to predicting same-day BDEs. The most informative phone sensor features for BDE prediction were time (e.g., time of day) and GPS-derived, such as radius of gyration (an indicator of travel). Interactions among key features (e.g., time of day, GPS-derived features) contributed to prediction of same-day BDE. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility and potential use of smartphone sensor data and machine learning to accurately predict imminent (same-day) BDEs in young adults. The prediction model provides "windows of opportunity" and with the adoption of XAI, we identified "key contributing features" to trigger JITAI prior to the onset of BDEs, with the potential to reduce the likelihood of BDEs in young adults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Real-time detection of drinking could improve timely delivery of interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related injury, but existing detection methods are burdensome or impractical. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. METHODS: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ({$>$}4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). RESULTS: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9\% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background: Mobile phone based real-time ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) have been used to record health risk behaviors, and antecedents to those behaviors, as they occur in near real time. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if intensive longitudinal data, collected via mobile phone, could be used to identify imminent risk for smoking lapse among socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers seeking smoking cessation treatment. Methods: Participants were recruited into a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial at an urban safety-net hospital tobacco cessation clinic. All participants completed in-person EMAs on mobile phones provided by the study. The presence of six commonly cited lapse risk variables (ie, urge to smoke, stress, recent alcohol consumption, interaction with someone smoking, cessation motivation, and cigarette availability) collected during 2152 prompted or self-initiated postcessation EMAs was examined to determine whether the number of lapse risk factors was greater when lapse was imminent (ie, within 4 hours) than when lapse was not imminent. Various strategies were used to weight variables in efforts to improve the predictive utility of the lapse risk estimator. Results: Participants (N=92) were mostly female (52/92, 57\%), minority (65/92, 71\%), 51.9 (SD 7.4) years old, and smoked 18.0 (SD 8.5) cigarettes per day. EMA data indicated significantly higher urges (P=.01), stress (P=.002), alcohol consumption (P{$<$}.001), interaction with someone smoking (P{$<$}.001), and lower cessation motivation (P=.03) within 4 hours of the first lapse compared with EMAs collected when lapse was not imminent. Further, the total number of lapse risk factors present within 4 hours of lapse (mean 2.43, SD 1.37) was significantly higher than the number of lapse risk factors present during periods when lapse was not imminent (mean 1.35, SD 1.04), P{$<$}.001. Overall, 62\% (32/52) of all participants who lapsed completed at least one EMA wherein they reported {$\geq$}3 lapse risk factors within 4 hours of their first lapse. Differentially weighting lapse risk variables resulted in an improved risk estimator (weighted area=0.76 vs unweighted area=0.72, P{$<$}.004). Specifically, 80\% (42/52) of all participants who lapsed had at least one EMA with a lapse risk score above the cut-off within 4 hours of their first lapse. Conclusions: Real-time estimation of smoking lapse risk is feasible and may pave the way for development of mobile phone based smoking cessation treatments that automatically tailor treatment content in real time based on presence of specific lapse triggers. Interventions that identify risk for lapse and automatically deliver tailored messages or other treatment components in real time},

  abstract = {Background. Mobile technology offers unique opportunities for monitoring short-term suicide risk in daily life. In this study of suicidal adolescent inpatients, theoretically informed risk factors were assessed daily following discharge to predict near-term suicidal ideation and inform decision algorithms for identifying elevations in daily level risk, with implications for real-time suicide-focused interventions. Methods. Adolescents (N = 78; 67.9\% female) completed brief surveys texted daily for 4 weeks after discharge (n = 1621 observations). Using multi-level classification and regression trees (CARTSs) with repeated 5-fold cross-validation, we tested (a) a simple prediction model incorporating previous-day scores for each of 10 risk factors, and (b) a more complex model incorporating, for each of these factors, a time-varying person-specific mean over prior days together with deviation from that mean. Models also incorporated missingness and contextual (study week, day of the week) indicators. The outcome was the presence/ absence of next-day suicidal ideation. Results. The best-performing model (cross-validated AUC = 0.86) was a complex model that included ideation duration, hopelessness, burdensomeness, and self-efficacy to refrain from suicidal action. An equivalent model that excluded ideation duration had acceptable overall performance (cross-validated AUC = 0.78). Models incorporating only previous-day scores, with and without ideation duration (cross-validated AUC of 0.82 and 0.75, respectively), showed relatively weaker performance. Conclusions. Results suggest that specific combinations of dynamic risk factors assessed in adolescents' daily life have promising utility in predicting next-day suicidal thoughts. Findings represent an important step in the development of decision tools identifying short-term risk as well as guiding timely interventions sensitive to proximal elevations in suicide risk in daily life.},

  abstract = {Background and objective Smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and diseases in the developed world, and advances in modern electronics and machine learning can help us deliver real-time intervention to smokers in novel ways. In this paper, we examine different machine learning approaches to use situational features associated with having or not having urges to smoke during a quit attempt in order to accurately classify high-urge states. Methods To test our machine learning approaches, specifically, Bayes, discriminant analysis and decision tree learning methods, we used a dataset collected from over 300 participants who had initiated a quit attempt. The three classification approaches are evaluated observing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision. Results The outcome of the analysis showed that algorithms based on feature selection make it possible to obtain high classification rates with only a few features selected from the entire dataset. The classification tree method outperformed the naive Bayes and discriminant analysis methods, with an accuracy of the classifications up to 86\%. These numbers suggest that machine learning may be a suitable approach to deal with smoking cessation matters, and to predict smoking urges, outlining a potential use for mobile health applications. Conclusions In conclusion, machine learning classifiers can help identify smoking situations, and the search for the best features and classifier parameters significantly improves the algorithms' performance. In addition, this study also supports the usefulness of new technologies in improving the effect of smoking cessation interventions, the management of time and patients by therapists, and thus the optimization of available health care resources. Future studies should focus on providing more adaptive and personalized support to people who really need it, in a minimum amount of time by developing novel expert systems capable of delivering real-time interventions.},

Effective smoking cessation JITAI rely on the development of accurate decision rules that determine when someone is most likely to lapse. The primary goal of the present study was to identify the strongest predictors of first lapse among smokers undergoing a quit attempt. Methods Smokers attending a clinic-based smoking cessation program (n\,=\,74) were asked to complete ecological momentary assessments five times daily on study-provided smartphones for 4 weeks post-quit. A three-stage modeling process utilized Cox proportional hazards regression to examine time to lapse a function of 31 predictors. First, univariate models evaluated the relationship between each predictor and time to lapse. Second, the elastic net machine learning algorithm was used to select the best predictors. Third, backwards elimination further reduced the set of predictors to optimize parsimony. Results Univariate models identified seven predictors significantly related to time to lapse. The elastic net algorithm retained five: perceived odds of smoking today, confidence in ability to avoid smoking, motivation to avoid smoking, urge to smoke, and cigarette availability. The reduced model demonstrated inadequate approximation to the non-penalized baseline model. Conclusions Accurate estimation of moments of high risk for smoking lapse remains an important goal in the development of JITAI. These results demonstrate the utility of exploratory data-driven approaches to variable selection. The results of this study can inform future JITAI by highlighting targets for intervention.},

Participants were 2185 adults (Mean age=36.4 years; 64\% women; 50\% Black) presenting for emergency care following traumatic exposure. Participants received a `flash survey' with 6--8 varying symptoms (from a pool of 26 trauma symptoms) several times per week for eight weeks following the trauma exposure (each symptom assessed {$\sim$}6 times). Features (mean, sd, last, worst, peak-end scores) from the repeatedly assessed symptoms were included as candidate variables in a CART machine learning analysis to develop a pragmatic predictive algorithm. PTSD (PCL-5~{$\geq$}38) was present for 669 (31\%) participants at the 8-week follow-up. A classification tree with three splits, based on mean scores of nervousness, rehashing, and fatigue, predicted PTSD with an Area Under the Curve of 0.836. Findings suggest feasibility for a 3-item assessment protocol, delivered once per week, following traumatic exposure to assess and potentially facilitate follow-up care for those at risk.},

Nevertheless, very little research has examined predicting depressed mood within a day, which is essential given the large amount of variation occurring within days. The current study utilized passively collected sensor data collected from a smartphone application to future depressed mood from hour-to-hour in an ecological momentary assessment study in a sample reporting clinical levels of depression (N = 31). Using a combination of nomothetic and idiographically-weighted machine learning models, the results suggest that depressed mood can be accurately predicted from hour to hour with an average correlation between out of sample predicted depressed mood levels and observed depressed mood of 0.587, CI [0.552, 0.621]. This suggests that passively collected smartphone data can accurately predict future depressed mood among a sample reporting clinical levels of depression. If replicated in other samples, this modeling framework may allow just-in-time adaptive interventions to treat depression as it changes in the context of daily life.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims While there are considerable benefits to Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), poor compliance with assessment protocols has been identified as a limitation, particularly in substance users. Our aim was to identify the pooled compliance rate of EMA studies in substance users and examine variables that may influence compliance with EMA protocols, such as the length and frequency of assessments. Design A meta-analysis and meta-regression of all possible studies (randomized controlled trials and longitudinal) which incorporated EMA protocols, examining substance use. Setting Studies took place from 1998 to 2017, in numerous countries world-wide. Participants One hundred and twenty-six studies were identified, contributing a total of 19~431 participants (52.32\% male, mean age~=~28.86). Measurements Compliance data, the proportion of responses to the study protocol, were extracted from each study alongside prompt frequency, total length of assessment period, substance use population and device used to administer EMA prompts. Findings The pooled compliance rate across all studies was 75.06\% [95\% confidence interval (CI)~=~72.37\%, 77.65\%]. There was no evidence that compliance rates were significantly associated with prompt frequency [Q(3) = 7.35, P~=~0.061], length of assessment period [Q(2) = 2.40, P~=~0.301], substance type [Q(3) = 6.30, P~=~0.098] or device administration [Q(4) = 4.28, P~=~0.369]. However, dependent samples (69.80\%) had lower compliance rates than non-dependent samples [76.02\%; Q(1) = 4.13, P~=~0.042]. Conclusions The pooled compliance rate for Ecological Momentary Assessment studies in substance-using populations from 1998 to 2017 was lower than the recommended rate of 80\%, and was not associated with frequency or duration of assessments.},

  abstract = {Background: Although geriatric depression is prevalent, diagnosis using self-reporting instruments has limitations when measuring the depressed mood of older adults in a community setting. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) by using wearable devices could be used to collect data to classify older adults into depression groups. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the classification of depression groups among older adults living alone. We focused on utilizing diverse data collected through a survey, an Actiwatch, and an EMA report related to depression. Methods: The prediction model using machine learning was developed in 4 steps: (1) data collection, (2) data processing and representation, (3) data modeling (feature engineering and selection), and (4) training and validation to test the prediction model. Older adults (N=47), living alone in community settings, completed an EMA to report depressed moods 4 times a day for 2 weeks between May 2017 and January 2018. Participants wore an Actiwatch that measured their activity and ambient light exposure every 30 seconds for 2 weeks. At baseline and the end of the 2-week observation, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Korean versions of the Short Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (K-HDRS). Conventional classification based on binary logistic regression was built and compared with 4 machine learning models (the logit, decision tree, boosted tree, and random forest models). Results: On the basis of the SGDS-K and K-HDRS, 38\% (18/47) of the participants were classified into the probable depression group. They reported significantly lower scores of normal mood and physical activity and higher levels of white and red, green, and blue (RGB) light exposures at different degrees of various 4-hour time frames (all P{$<$}.05). Sleep efficiency was chosen for modeling through feature selection. Comparing diverse combinations of the selected variables, daily mean EMA score, daily mean activity level, white and RGB light at 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm exposure, and daily sleep efficiency were selected for modeling. Conventional classification based on binary logistic regression had a good model fit (accuracy: 0.705; precision: 0.770; specificity: 0.859; and area under receiver operating characteristic curve or AUC: 0.754). Among the 4 machine learning models, the logit model had the best fit compared with the others (accuracy: 0.910; precision: 0.929; specificity: 0.940; and AUC: 0.960). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for developing a machine learning program to predict the classification of depression groups in older adults living alone. Clinicians should consider using this method to identify underdiagnosed subgroups and monitor daily progression regarding treatment or therapeutic intervention in the community setting. Furthermore, more efforts are needed for researchers and clinicians to diversify data collection methods by using a survey, EMA, and a sensor.},

Available treatments often fail to support long-term recovery by failing to account for the dynamic nature of long-term recovery. Objective: The aim of this protocol paper is to describe research that aims to develop a highly contextualized lapse risk prediction model that forecasts the ongoing probability of lapse. Methods: The participants will include 480 US adults in their first year of recovery from OUD. Participants will report lapses and provide data relevant to lapse risk for a year with a digital therapeutic smartphone app through both self-report and passive personal sensing methods (eg, cellular communications and geolocation). The lapse risk prediction model will be developed using contemporary rigorous machine learning methods that optimize prediction in new data.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board approved this project on July 9, 2019. Pilot enrollment began on April 16, 2021. Full enrollment began in September 2021. Conclusions: The model that will be developed in this project could support long-term recovery from OUD---for example, by enabling just-in-time interventions within digital therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in a substantial minority of emergency room admits. Inexpensive and accurate person-level assessment of PTSD risk after trauma exposure is a critical precursor to large-scale deployment of early interventions that may reduce individual suffering and societal costs. Toward this aim, we applied ensemble machine learning to predict PTSD screening status three months after severe injury using cost-effective and minimally invasive data. Participants (N = 271) were recruited at a Level 1 Trauma Center where they provided variables routinely collected at the hospital, including pulse, injury severity, and demographics, as well as psychological variables, including self-reported current depression, psychiatric history, and social support. Participant zip codes were used to extract contextual variables including population total and density, average annual income, and health insurance coverage rates from publicly available U.S. Census data. Machine learning yielded good prediction of PTSD screening status 3 months post-hospitalization, AUC\,=\,0.85 95\% CI [0.83, 0.86], and significantly outperformed all benchmark comparison models in a cross-validation procedure designed to yield an unbiased estimate of performance. These results demonstrate that good prediction can be attained from variables that individually have relatively weak predictive value, pointing to the promise of ensemble machine learning approaches that do not rely on strong isolated risk factors.},

  abstract = {Depression is currently the second most significant contributor to non-fatal disease burdens globally. While it is treatable, depression remains undiagnosed in many cases. As mobile phones have now become an integral part of daily life, this study examines the possibility of screening for depressive symptoms continuously based on patients' mobile usage patterns.412 research participants reported a range of their mobile usage statistics. Beck Depression Inventory---2nd ed (BDI-II) was used to measure the severity of depression among participants. A wide array of machine learning classification algorithms was trained to detect participants with depression symptoms (ie, BDI-II score {$\geq$} 14). The relative importance of individual variables was additionally quantified.Participants with depression were found to have fewer saved contacts on their devices, spend more time on their mobile devices to make and receive fewer and shorter calls, and send more text messages than participants without depression. The best model was a random forest classifier, which had an out-of-sample balanced accuracy of 0.768. The balanced accuracy increased to 0.811 when participants' age and gender were included.The significant predictive power of mobile usage attributes implies that, by collecting mobile usage statistics, mental health mobile applications can continuously screen for depressive symptoms for initial diagnosis or for monitoring the progress of ongoing treatments. Moreover, the input variables used in this study were aggregated mobile usage metadata attributes, which has low privacy sensitivity making it more likely for patients to grant required application permissions.},

  abstract = {Background Accurate clinical prediction supports the effective treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other psychiatric disorders. Traditional statistical techniques have identified patient characteristics associated with treatment outcomes. However, less work has focused on systematically leveraging these associations to create optimal predictive models. The current study demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict clinical outcomes in people completing outpatient AUD treatment. Method We used data from the COMBINE multisite clinical trial (n = 1383) to develop and test predictive models. We identified three priority prediction targets, including (1) heavy drinking during the first month of treatment, (2) heavy drinking during the last month of treatment, and (3) heavy drinking between weekly/bi-weekly sessions. Models were generated using the random forest algorithm. We used ``leave sites out'' partitioning to externally validate the models in trial sites that were not included in the model training. Stratified model development was used to test for sex differences in the relative importance of predictive features. Results Models predicting heavy alcohol use during the first and last months of treatment showed internal cross-validation area under the curve (AUC) scores ranging from 0.67 to 0.74. AUC was comparable in the external validation using data from held-out sites (AUC range = 0.69 to 0.72). The model predicting between-session heavy drinking showed strong classification accuracy in internal cross-validation (AUC = 0.89) and external test samples (AUC range = 0.80 to 0.87). Stratified analyses showed substantial sex differences in optimal feature sets. Conclusion Machine learning techniques can predict alcohol treatment outcomes using routinely collected clinical data. This technique has the potential to greatly improve clinical prediction accuracy without requiring expensive or invasive assessment methods. More research is needed to understand how best to deploy these models.},

  abstract = {Adults experiencing homelessness are more likely to have an alcohol use disorder compared to adults in the general population. Although shelter-based treatments are common, completion rates tend to be poor, suggesting a need for more effective approaches that are tailored to this understudied and underserved population. One barrier to developing more effective treatments is the limited knowledge of the triggers of alcohol use among homeless adults. This paper describes the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to identify predictors of ``imminent drinking'' (i.e., drinking within the next 4 h), among a sample of adults experiencing homelessness and receiving health services at a homeless shelter. A total of 78 mostly male (84.6\%) adults experiencing homelessness (mean age = 46.6) who reported hazardous drinking completed up to five EMAs per day over 4 weeks (a total of 4557 completed EMAs). The study used machine learning techniques to create a drinking risk algorithm that predicted 82\% of imminent drinking episodes within 4 h of the first drink of the day, and correctly identified 76\% of nondrinking episodes. The algorithm included the following 7 predictors of imminent drinking: urge to drink, having alcohol easily available, feeling confident that alcohol would improve mood, feeling depressed, lower commitment to being alcohol free, not interacting with someone drinking alcohol, and being indoors. The research team used the results to develop intervention content (e.g., brief tailored messages) that will be delivered when imminent drinking is detected in an upcoming intervention phase. Specifically, we created three theoretically grounded message tracks focused on urge/craving, social/availability, and negative affect/mood, which are further tailored to a participant's current drinking goal (i.e., stay sober, drink less, no goal) to support positive change. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop tailored intervention messages based on likelihood of imminent drinking, current drinking triggers, and drinking goals among adults experiencing homelessness.},

  abstract = {Background: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. Objective: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. Methods: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50\% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87\% White and n=150, 97\% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants' choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. Results: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5\%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6\%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9\%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P\&lt;.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04). Conclusions: These results suggest that active and passive sensing methods are acceptable for people with alcohol use disorder over a longer period than has previously been assessed. Important individual differences were observed across people and methods, indicating opportunities for future improvement.},

  abstract = {We developed three machine learning models that predict hour-by-hour probabilities of a future lapse back to alcohol use with increasing temporal precision (i.e., lapses in the next week, next day, and next hour). Model features were based on raw scores and longitudinal change in theoretically implicated risk factors collected through ecological momentary assessment. Participants (N = 151, 51\% male, Mage = 41, 87\% White, 97\% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1--8 weeks of abstinence) from alcohol use disorder provided 4 {\texttimes} daily ecological momentary assessment for up to 3 months. We used grouped, nested cross-validation to select the best models and evaluate the performance of those best models. Models yielded median areas under the receiver operating curves of 0.89, 0.90, and 0.93 in the 30 held-out test sets for week-, day-, and hour-level models, respectively. Some feature categories consistently emerged as being globally important to lapse prediction across our week-, day-, and hour-level models (i.e., past use, future self-efficacy). However, most of the more punctate, time-varying constructs (e.g., craving, past stressful events, arousal) appear to have a greater impact within the next-hour prediction model. This research represents an important step toward the development of a smart (machine learning guided) sensing system that can both identify periods of peak lapse risk and recommend specific supports to address factors contributing to this risk.
